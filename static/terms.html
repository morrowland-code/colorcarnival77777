    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><b>Last Updated:</b> November 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <b>Color Carnival</b>! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of
      our app, website, and any related features or services operated by the Color Carnival team (“we,” “our,” “us”).
      By using Color Carnival, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Using the App</h2>
    <p>
      Color Carnival is designed to help you build, match, and save color palettes and grids in a fun and creative way.
      You must be at least 13 years old to use this app or have permission from a parent or guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse the app, interfere with others’ use, or attempt to hack, reverse-engineer, or disrupt the app’s services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      You may create an account to save palettes, grids, or preferences.
      Please keep your login information private — you are responsible for all activity under your account.
      We may suspend or delete accounts that violate these Terms or misuse the app.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Content (Your Palettes & Art)</h2>
    <p>
      You retain full ownership of any palettes, images, or artwork you create or upload using Color Carnival.
      By uploading, you grant us a limited license to store and display your content within your account
      so the app can function properly — nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will never sell, share, or publicly post your artwork or palette data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Payments and Premium Features</h2>
    <p>
      Some features (like advanced color mixing) may require a one-time purchase or unlock code.
      All payments are securely processed through official platforms (e.g., Apple, Google, or Stripe).
      Purchases are final unless required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of Color Carnival is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      By using the app, you agree that we may handle your data as described there.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The Color Carnival name, Strawbebby mascot, logo, artwork, and design elements belong to the creators of Color Carnival.
      You may not copy, distribute, or resell the app or its components without permission.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      Color Carnival is provided “as is.” While we do our best to make it stable and fun,
      we cannot guarantee it will always be free from errors or interruptions.
      Use the app at your own discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent allowed by law, Color Carnival is not responsible for any data loss, damages,
      or issues resulting from using or being unable to use the app.
      Always back up your work regularly.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect new features or requirements.
      Any major updates will be announced within the app or on our website.
